CSharpRenderer
==============

C#/.NET DirectX11 based graphics framework for rapid visual effects and algorithms prototyping

More about my motivation when creating it http://bartwronski.com/2014/04/10/c-net-graphics-framework/ 

Please note that provided code is in early stage, provided "as it is" (licence) and will change in time, probably breaking backwards compatibility.

Known issues: At the moment only x64 version was tested and ddls are compatible with it. You also need Visual Studio 2012+ Runtime / Redistributable if you get "failed to load lua52.dll" exception.
